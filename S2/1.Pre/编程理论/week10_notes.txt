Exponentiation problem:

Inv is not TRUE. For the following state Inv is false:
{x:10,n:2,y:2,b:3,i:5}
because 2*243=100 does not hold.

The variant function return an integer value for any state. In our case it was given that the variant function (denoted by t) is the same as the function i.
t({x:10,n:2,y:2,b:3,i:5}) = 5

Specification
In case the x is 123, there is only one possible value that can be associated to variable d, such that the postcondition holds. That is d=3:
{x:123,d:4}
1000 <= 123 < 10000
For the state {x:123,d:4} the postcondition is false.

{x:123,d:3}
100 <= 123 < 1000
For the state {x:123,d:3} the postcondition is true.

Determine the number of digits of the given natural number x.
This problem was described by its specification.
